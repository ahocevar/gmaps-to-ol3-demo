Switching from Google Maps v2 to OpenLayers 3
=============================================

On November 19, 2013, version 2 of the Google Maps API has been turned down. Inspired by a recent [MapBox blog post](https://mapbox.com/blog/switching-to-mapboxjs/), I decided to compare the [Google Maps version 3 API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/) to the [beta.1](https://github.com/openlayers/ol3/releases/tag/v3.0.0-beta.1) version of [OpenLayers 3](http://ol3js.org).
